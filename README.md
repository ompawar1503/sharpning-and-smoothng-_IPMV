Sharpening is used to enhance the edges and fine details in an image. It helps make the image appear clearer and more defined by emphasizing areas of high contrast or rapid intensity changes.
Smoothing (also called blurring) is used to reduce noise and fine details in an image, creating a soft and uniform appearance. It's especially useful in tasks like denoising, background subtraction, and preprocessing before further analysis.
